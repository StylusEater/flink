INTRODUCTION
============

Thank you for your interest in [flink-javascript](http://github.com/styluseater/flink-javascript).

TESTING
-------

In order to run tests you will need to have the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) toolkit installed. Then install
 the [Karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma) test runner and the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)
 JavaScript testing framework. 

Once you have these tools installed you will want to create karma.conf.js using 
 the karma.conf.js.example file. Of particular note you will want to adjust base,
 baseSRC and baseTESTS to match the locations of your project, the location of 
 your source files and your tests respectively. You may also wish to build out
 your own karam.conf.js file using the command:
 
 > karma init karma.conf.js
 
 and following the prompts. 
 
 When you're done configuring karma you will want to run it using the command:
 
 > karma start
 
 and watch for failed tests in the console. Enjoy!
